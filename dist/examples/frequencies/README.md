# Frequencies
This example prints the frequencies of each of the branches, sub branches and peripherals. It uses the methods provided by emlib, but allows one to verify if clock setup is correct.

**Note:** the frequencies are as-is. In other words, they are as as calculated using the current peripheral state.
