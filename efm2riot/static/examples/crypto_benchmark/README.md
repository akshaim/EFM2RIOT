# Crypto Benchmark

In this example, hardware AES encryption is compared to the software AES version. Both versions use plain AES-128.

## Sample output
On the SLSTK3401A @ 40 MHz:

```
main(): This is RIOT! (Version: 2016.03-devel-455-ga64a-MacBook-van-Bas.lan)
Starting benchmarks.

AES: completed 210699 ops in 10 seconds.
HWAES: completed 869808 ops in 10 seconds.

Benchmarks done!
```
